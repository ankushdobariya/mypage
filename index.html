            Ever find yourself fixated on stretching a particular part of your body? When your hamstrings are tight,
            for example, you might zero in on doing hamstring stretches. Despite your desire to target one area,
            however,
            that’s not how your body works.
        </div>
        <div class="content-info">
            Everything is interconnected. Just as you can’t fully appreciate the experience of daylight without also
            experiencing night,
            you can’t stretch a particular muscle without acknowledging (or at least inadvertently incorporating)
            the muscles that support it.
        </div>
        <div class="content-info">
            Take those tight hamstrings. Understanding exactly how they and nearby muscles support one another
            isn’t essential for you to practice hamstring stretches and find relief.
            But understanding how your hip flexors can contribute to the problem—and, in turn,
            help alleviate it—enables you to more effectively address the situation.

            <div>The Anatomy of Tight Hamstrings and Hip Flexors</div>
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="content-info">
            The hamstrings fall on the opposite side of your thigh bone. They comprise three muscles that originate on
            the ischial tuberosity (your sit bones),
            run along the back of the thigh, cross behind the knee joint,
            and attach to the lower leg. When your knee bends, the hamstrings contract. When your leg straightens,
            they lengthen.
        </div>
        <div class="content-info">
            The contraction, or shortening, of the hip flexor muscles happens in tandem with the lengthening,
            or stretching, of the hamstring muscles. For example, in a forward bend, the hip flexors contract
            to help you bend forward at your hips, which lengthens the hamstrings. Same thing happens when you
            draw your knee toward your chest.
        </div>
        <div class="content-info">
            But if the hip flexors are tight or weak, this can lead to an anterior (forward) tilt of the pelvis.
            This forward tilt, ironically, creates tension in the hamstring muscles.
            Instead of helping your hamstrings become more flexible, this constant tugging causes them to feel even
            tighter.

            The secret to Hyperbolic Stretching lies in the development of the pelvic muscle floor.
            Most people are unable to achieve full range of motion and reach their optimum level
            of Flexibility due to a natural 'survival reflex' that causes muscles to automatically
            contact when strached . By targeting the pelvic muscles with the special isolation
            excercises detailed in Hyperblic Stretching, you can, in effect , switch off this automatic
            tension relax and open a whole of muscle elasticity.
